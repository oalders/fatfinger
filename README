NAME
    fatfinger - Catch typos in module names

VERSION
    version 0.000001

SYNOPSIS
        use strict;
        use warnings;
        use fatfinger;

DESCRIPTION
    "fatfinger" is a development tool which helps you spot typos in "use"
    statements. It does this by adding an @INC hook. First it checks %INC
    for similarly named modules. If this comes up empty "fatfinger" will do
    some fuzzy matching on the files in your @INC.

    In order for "fatfinger" to be effective, "use" it as early as possible
    in your modules.

    For example:

        use strict;
        use fatfinger;
        use bwarnings;

    When running this code, you should get the following error message:

        ----------
        bwarnings could not be found. Did you really mean warnings?
        ----------

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    Thanks to Dave Rolsky, Greg Oschwald and Florian Ragwitz for helping me
    with the logic behind this module.
