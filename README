NAME
    fatfinger - Catch typos in module names

VERSION
    version 0.000001

SYNOPSIS
        use strict;
        use warnings;
        use fatfinger;

DESCRIPTION
    "fatfinger" is a development tool which helps you spot typos in "use"
    statements. It does this by adding an @INC hook. First it checks %INC
    for similarly named modules. If this comes up empty "fatfinger" will do
    some fuzzy matching on the files in your @INC.

    In order for "fatfinger" to be effective, "use" it as early as possible
    in your modules.

    For example:

        use strict;
        use fatfinger;
        use warningz;

    When running this code, you should get the following error message:

        ----------
        The module "warningz" could not be found. Perhaps you meant to "use warnings"?
        ----------

CAVEATS
    This will add a (hopefully) small penalty to the run time of your code
    if a module cannot be found. Presently it seems to be fast enough for
    me, but it may not be fast enough for you.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    Thanks to Dave Rolsky, Greg Oschwald and Florian Ragwitz for helping me
    with the logic behind this module.
